/* Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-difference-between-highest-and-lowest-of-k-scores
You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums, where nums[i] represents the score of the ith student. You are also given an integer k.

Pick the scores of any k students from the array so that the difference between the highest and the lowest of the k scores is minimized.

Return the minimum possible difference.
